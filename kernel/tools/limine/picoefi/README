PicoEFI
=======

PicoEFI is a minimal build environment for EFI applications, originally forked
from GNU-EFI, that strips out all library code save for the relocation stubs
and the EFI header files. It also features a rework and fixage of said
relocation stubs, and provides updated linker scripts.

For an example on how to use this, see:
