Welcome to ospabOS Microkernel v0.35!

This is a test file loaded from the initrd.
The VFS service reads files provided as Limine modules.

Features:
- Message-passing IPC architecture
- Limine Memory Map based heap allocation
- UEFI framebuffer support (RGB/BGR auto-detection)
- Serial port logging for hardware debugging
- Initrd-based virtual filesystem

Try these commands:
  ls       - list all files in initrd
  cat test.txt - display this file
  pwd      - show current directory
  uptime   - show system uptime
  version  - show kernel version

Happy hacking!
